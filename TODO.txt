- make it so text bitmap is intermediarily handled in iwram, then before vsync
  DMA it to the correct portion of VRAM (perhaps limit it to one line per frame
  or something. i dunno.) this theoretically should make it faster writing text
  in case that it is too slow, because iwram is (probably) faster to read/write
  from/to than vram.
